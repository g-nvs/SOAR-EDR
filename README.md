# SOAR & EDR Project Lab

## Objective

This Lab objectives are mainly to gain practical experience on a EDR and get to know how to properly analyze an incident detected by the Sensor, and also to put in place effective Detections Rules in order to continuously improve Security.
Once Detections are accurate, the interesting part is to automatically respond to the incident, whenever it is possible, through the EDR.
